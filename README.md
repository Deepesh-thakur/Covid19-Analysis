Collected and analyzed COVID-19 confirmed cases data from the National Center for Health Statistics using Python and Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning. 

Aggregated country-wise infection data by grouping and summing daily case counts, enabling clear comparison across regions. 

Utilized Matplotlib to visualize time-series trends of COVID-19 spread for multiple countries, identifying key differences in infection growth curves. 

Calculated the maximum daily infection rate for each country using Pandas diff() function, extracting meaningful health risk indicators from raw data.
